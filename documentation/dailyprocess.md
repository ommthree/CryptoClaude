# CryptoClaude Daily Development Process

## Overview
This document defines the standard daily development workflow for the CryptoClaude project, ensuring consistent quality gates and progress tracking.

## Process Authority
**Owner:** SDM (orchestration and enforcement)
**Modification Rights:** Project Owner only
**Execution Frequency:** Every development day

## Daily Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Daily Planning (SDM Orchestrated)

#### Planning Preparation
**Responsibility:** SDM
**Activities:**
1. Review previous day's completion status from dayplan.md
2. Analyze current week's progress against weeklyplanning.md targets
3. Identify any blockers or dependency issues from previous day
4. Assess need for plan modifications based on current state

#### Clarification Requests
**Trigger:** Uncertain requirements or major plan deviations needed
**Process:**
1. SDM identifies specific decision points or clarifications needed
2. SDM requests input from Project Owner on:
   - Algorithm modifications
   - Target state adjustments
   - Major architectural decisions
   - Resource allocation changes

#### Daily Plan Creation
**Responsibility:** SDM
**Process:**
1. SDM creates/updates dayplan.md based on weeklyplanning.md
2. SDM defines specific daily tasks with clear action steps
3. SDM establishes success criteria focusing on:
   - Component existence and functionality
   - Compilation success
   - Test passing status
   - Validator approval
   - Project Owner approval (if required)

### Stage 2: Plan Review (Conditional)

#### TRS Review Trigger
**Condition:** Daily plan includes algorithm changes or risk modifications
**Process:**
1. TRS reviews dayplan.md for algorithm impact
2. TRS assesses risk implications of proposed changes
3. TRS generates tradval.md report with concerns/recommendations
4. Project Owner reviews TRS report and approves/modifies plan

#### Direct Approval
**Condition:** No algorithm changes in daily plan
**Process:**
1. SDM submits dayplan.md directly to Project Owner
2. Project Owner reviews and approves daily plan
3. Development stage authorized to begin

### Stage 3: Development Execution (Developer Autonomous)

#### Implementation Phase
**Responsibility:** Developer
**Authority:** Autonomous execution within approved plan boundaries
**Activities:**
1. Execute daily tasks as defined in dayplan.md
2. Implement creative and lateral solutions within requirements
3. Maintain alignment with target state vision
4. Document implementation decisions in arch.md as needed

#### On-the-Fly Testing
**Responsibility:** Developer
**Requirements:**
1. Code compilation verification after each major change
2. Unit testing for new components
3. Integration testing for modified interfaces
4. Functional testing for user-facing features
5. Smoke testing for end-to-end workflows

#### Progress Tracking
**Process:**
1. Developer updates dayplan.md completion status in real-time
2. Developer marks success criteria as achieved
3. Developer notes any deviations or issues encountered
4. Developer escalates to SDM if plan modifications needed

### Stage 4: Comprehensive Daily Validation (Validator)

#### Enhanced Validation Framework - "No Shortcuts Policy"
**Time Allocation:** 45-90 minutes (quality over speed)
**Principle:** **NEVER simplify tests to avoid failures - identify and document real issues**

#### Critical Validation Areas

##### 1. **Dependency Integrity Validation** - MANDATORY
**Process:**
1. **External Dependencies:** Verify all `#include` statements resolve correctly
   - Check for missing libraries (nlohmann/json, boost, etc.)
   - Validate system dependencies are installed
   - Document any missing dependencies as BLOCKERS
2. **Internal Dependencies:** Verify all internal includes exist
   - Check for missing .cpp implementation files
   - Validate header-only libraries have complete implementations
   - Flag any "header-only" components that should have implementations

##### 2. **Database Integration Validation** - MANDATORY
**Process:**
1. **Method Compatibility:** Verify all database method calls exist
   - Check DatabaseManager interface matches usage
   - Identify calls to non-existent methods (executeParameterizedQuery, etc.)
   - Test with actual database operations, not mocked versions
2. **Migration System:** Test database schema migrations
   - Attempt actual migration execution
   - Document migration failures as CRITICAL issues
   - Never bypass migrations - fix the underlying problem
3. **SQL Security:** Review all database queries for security issues
   - Flag string concatenation in SQL queries as SQL INJECTION RISK
   - Require prepared statements for all parameterized queries

##### 3. **Compilation Reality Check** - MANDATORY
**Process:**
1. **Full Compilation:** Compile ALL code without shortcuts
   - Include all dependencies and headers
   - No conditional compilation to bypass errors
   - Document all compilation failures with full error details
2. **Implementation Completeness:** Verify implementation files exist
   - Check that all header declarations have corresponding implementations
   - Flag missing .cpp files as CRITICAL BLOCKERS
   - Validate function implementations, not just declarations

##### 4. **Functional Reality Testing** - MANDATORY
**Process:**
1. **End-to-End Testing:** Test actual functionality, not mock operations
   - Use real API calls where possible (with test keys)
   - Test actual file I/O operations
   - Verify database operations with real data
2. **Error Path Validation:** Test failure scenarios
   - Network failures, invalid API responses
   - Database connection failures
   - Missing configuration scenarios
3. **No Simplification Policy:** If a test fails, document the failure - don't simplify the test

##### 5. **Architecture Consistency Validation** - MANDATORY
**Process:**
1. **Interface Compatibility:** Verify all interfaces match implementations
   - Check method signatures match between headers and implementations
   - Validate return types and parameter types
   - Test actual method calls, not simplified versions
2. **Design Pattern Integrity:** Ensure architectural patterns are properly implemented
   - Singleton patterns properly implemented
   - Factory patterns create actual objects
   - Observer patterns have functional notification systems

#### Validation Process

**Phase 1: Pre-Compilation Analysis (15 minutes)**
1. Review all include statements for missing dependencies
2. Check for existence of all referenced implementation files
3. Validate database method signatures against actual DatabaseManager interface
4. Document all missing dependencies and files as BLOCKERS

**Phase 2: Compilation Testing (20 minutes)**
1. Attempt compilation of ALL components without shortcuts
2. Document compilation errors with full compiler output
3. Identify root causes of failures (missing deps, wrong interfaces, etc.)
4. **NEVER** modify code to "make tests pass" - document real issues

**Phase 3: Functional Validation (30 minutes)**
1. Execute comprehensive integration tests
2. Test with real external dependencies where possible
3. Validate database operations with actual database
4. Test error handling with realistic failure scenarios

**Phase 4: Security and Performance Review (15 minutes)**
1. Review SQL queries for injection vulnerabilities
2. Check for proper error handling and resource cleanup
3. Validate timeout and rate limiting implementations
4. Review configuration management security
