# CryptoClaude Setup Process

## Overview
This document defines the one-time setup process for establishing the structured development framework for the CryptoClaude trading platform project.

## Setup Phase Orchestration
**Process Owner:** Software Development Manager (SDM)
**Authority:** Project Owner approval required for process modifications

## Phase 1: Project Organization

### File Structure Setup
- [x] Create archive/ directory for legacy documentation
- [x] Create documentation/ directory for structured planning files
- [x] Create tests/ directory for centralized test management
- [x] Move existing .md files to archive/ directory
- [x] Move test files and executables to tests/ directory

### Documentation Framework Creation
- [x] Create agents.md (team role definitions)
- [x] Create md.md (documentation index and ownership)
- [x] Create setupprocess.md (this document)
- [ ] Create dailyprocess.md (daily workflow definition)
- [ ] Create weeklyprocess.md (weekly review cycle definition)

**Success Criteria:** Clean project structure with organized file hierarchy

## Phase 2: Strategic Document Creation

### Algorithm Specification (algo.md)
**Responsibility:** SDM drafts → Project Owner approves
**Process:**
1. SDM reviews existing codebase and archived planning documents
2. SDM requests clarifications on trading strategy from Project Owner
3. SDM drafts comprehensive algorithm specification
4. TRS reviews algo.md and provides tradval.md report
5. Project Owner reviews TRS feedback and approves/modifies algo.md
6. Document locked to Project Owner authority

**Required Clarifications from Project Owner:**
- Long-short pairing strategy details
- Risk management parameters and thresholds
- Portfolio allocation methodology
- Rebalancing triggers and frequency
- Performance targets and success metrics

### Target State Specification (target.md)
**Responsibility:** SDM drafts → Project Owner approves
**Process:**
1. SDM analyzes current system capabilities
2. SDM requests clarification on user interface requirements
3. SDM drafts comprehensive target state specification
4. Document sent for Project Owner approval
5. Document locked to Project Owner authority

**Required Clarifications from Project Owner:**
- Console interface functionality requirements
- Expected user workflows and interactions
- System outputs and reporting requirements
- Performance and reliability expectations
- Integration requirements with external systems

### Database Schema Specification (schema.md)
**Responsibility:** SDM drafts → Project Owner approves (with evolution rights)
**Process:**
1. SDM reviews existing database models and usage patterns
2. SDM requests clarification on data requirements
3. SDM drafts comprehensive schema specification
4. Validator reviews for technical feasibility
5. Project Owner approves initial schema
6. Document allows future evolution with SDM + Project Owner approval

**Required Clarifications from Project Owner:**
- Historical data retention requirements
- Performance data storage needs
- Risk reporting data requirements
- Audit trail and compliance needs
- External data integration requirements

## Phase 3: Tactical Document Creation

### Technical Architecture (arch.md)
**Responsibility:** SDM drafts → Developer reviews and refines
**Process:**
1. SDM documents current architecture based on existing codebase
2. SDM defines C++/SQLite/Visual Studio development environment
3. Developer reviews and provides refinement suggestions
4. SDM finalizes architecture document
5. Developer granted daily refinement authority

### Business Requirements (busreq.md)
**Responsibility:** SDM creates and maintains
**Process:**
1. SDM creates granular requirements based on target.md and algo.md
2. SDM maps existing codebase against requirements
3. SDM marks completed components and identifies gaps
4. Developer granted authority to mark completion progress
5. SDM maintains requirement modifications and approval authority

### Weekly Planning (weeklyplanning.md)
**Responsibility:** SDM creates → Developer updates progress
**Process:**
1. SDM analyzes current system state vs. target requirements
2. SDM creates week-by-week development plan with clear success criteria
3. SDM identifies work already completed and marks accordingly
4. SDM defines remaining work needed to reach target state
5. Developer granted authority to update progress and suggest tactical changes
6. SDM maintains approval authority for strategic plan modifications

## Phase 4: Process Activation

### Team Readiness Validation
**Checkpoints:**
- [ ] All strategic documents approved by Project Owner
- [ ] All tactical documents created and reviewed
- [ ] Validator familiar with validation requirements
- [ ] TRS familiar with algorithm assessment criteria
- [ ] Developer familiar with planning structure and authority levels

### Initial Daily Plan Creation
**Process:**
1. SDM creates first dayplan.md based on weeklyplanning.md
2. TRS reviews if algorithm changes are planned
3. Project Owner approves initial daily plan
4. Daily process cycle begins

## Setup Success Criteria

### Documentation Completeness:
- [x] Core organizational documents created (agents.md, md.md, processes)
- [ ] Strategic documents completed and approved (target.md, algo.md, schema.md)
- [ ] Tactical documents created and reviewed (arch.md, busreq.md, weeklyplanning.md)
- [ ] All documents follow ownership and authority rules

### Team Readiness:
- [ ] Each agent understands their role and authority levels
- [ ] Review and approval processes tested
- [ ] Initial validation and TRS reports successfully generated
- [ ] Project Owner satisfied with document quality and completeness

### System Integration:
- [ ] Current codebase properly documented in architecture
- [ ] Completed work properly marked in planning documents
- [ ] Gap analysis completed between current state and target
- [ ] Clear development path established for remaining work

## Post-Setup Transition

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. Begin daily process cycle with first dayplan.md
2. Developer begins autonomous execution within planning framework
3. Validation cycles establish quality rhythm
4. Weekly review process validates comprehensive progress

### Process Maturation:
- First week: Light process implementation to build familiarity
- Second week: Full process implementation with all validation cycles
- Ongoing: Process refinement based on experience and effectiveness
