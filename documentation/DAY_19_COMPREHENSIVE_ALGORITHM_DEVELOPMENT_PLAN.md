        double p_value;                     // Statistical significance
        double confidence_interval_low;     // 95% CI lower bound
        double confidence_interval_high;    // 95% CI upper bound
        int sample_size;                    // Number of predictions
        bool meets_trs_requirement();      // ‚â•0.85 && p<0.05
    };

    CorrelationAnalysis analyzeCorrelation(
        const std::vector<PredictionResult>& predictions,
        const std::vector<double>& actual_outcomes
    );
};
```

std::vector<CorrelationAnalysis> walkForwardValidation(
    CoreTradingAlgorithm& algorithm,
    const TimeRange& full_period,
    std::chrono::days training_window = std::chrono::days{180},
    std::chrono::days testing_window = std::chrono::days{30}
);
```
