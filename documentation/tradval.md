# Trading and Risk Specialist Assessment - Algorithm Specification

## Executive Summary
The proposed algorithm specification represents a sound market-neutral strategy with appropriate risk controls. However, several critical parameters require quantitative definition for production implementation.

## Algorithm Assessment

### Strategy Viability: **POSITIVE**
**Strengths:**
- Market-neutral approach reduces systematic risk exposure
- Inflow-based prediction methodology captures momentum with volume confirmation
- Sentiment-driven features provide fundamental edge potential
- Symmetrical pairing structure maintains balance

**Concerns:**
- Heavy reliance on sentiment data quality and availability
- Gamma factor stability critical to strategy performance
- Hourly rebalancing frequency may increase transaction costs significantly

### Risk Framework Evaluation: **REQUIRES QUANTIFICATION**

## Critical Parameter Recommendations

### 1. Default Risk Metrics and Thresholds for Coin Exclusion

#### Recommended Exclusion Criteria:

**Gamma Factor Stability:**
- **Threshold:** Exclude coins with gamma coefficient of variation > 50% over 30-day window
- **Rationale:** Unstable gamma indicates unreliable price prediction model
- **Monitoring:** Daily recalculation with 7-day rolling exclusion decision

**Liquidity Requirements:**
- **Minimum Daily Volume:** $1M USD equivalent
- **Bid-Ask Spread:** Maximum 2% for inclusion
- **Market Cap:** Minimum $100M to ensure reasonable liquidity

**Data Quality Thresholds:**
- **News Coverage:** Minimum 3 articles per week for sentiment analysis
- **Price Data Completeness:** 95% data availability over trailing 30 days
- **Volume Anomaly:** Exclude if volume deviates >5 standard deviations from 30-day mean

### 2. Stop-Loss Recommendations

#### Pair-Level Stop Losses (Aggressive):
- **Individual Pair Drawdown:** -15% from pair inception value
- **Rationale:** Allows for normal pair volatility while limiting catastrophic losses
- **Implementation:** Daily mark-to-market with immediate liquidation trigger

#### Portfolio-Level Stop Loss (Conservative):
- **Total Portfolio Drawdown:** -10% from high-water mark
- **Rationale:** Preserves capital while allowing strategy time to work
- **Implementation:** End-of-day assessment with next-day liquidation if triggered

#### Risk Budget Allocation:
- **Per Pair Risk Budget:** 2% of total portfolio value maximum loss
- **Total Active Risk Budget:** 8% of portfolio (allowing for 4 pairs maximum concentration)

### 3. Rebalancing Decision Framework

#### Cost-Benefit Analysis:
**Minimum Expected Improvement:** 25 basis points improvement to justify rebalancing
**Transaction Cost Estimation:** 10-15 basis points per round-trip trade
**Net Benefit Threshold:** Expected return improvement must exceed 1.5x transaction costs

#### Risk-Adjusted Rebalancing Triggers:
- **Correlation Breakdown:** Rebalance if pair correlation exceeds 0.7 (loss of hedge effectiveness)
- **Volatility Spike:** Rebalance if pair volatility exceeds 2x historical average
- **Momentum Reversal:** Rebalance if prediction confidence falls below 60th percentile

#### Dynamic Frequency Adjustment:
- **High Volatility Periods:** Reduce rebalancing to 4-hour minimum intervals
- **Low Volatility Periods:** Allow up to hourly rebalancing
- **Market Stress:** Suspend rebalancing during extreme market conditions (VIX crypto equivalent > 80)

### 4. Performance and Risk Metrics Specification

#### Hourly Reporting Metrics:
**Return Metrics:**
- Absolute portfolio return (1-hour)
- Long book performance vs benchmark
- Short book performance vs benchmark
- Pair-by-pair attribution

**Risk Metrics:**
- Portfolio beta to crypto market
- Long-short correlation coefficient
- Current leverage utilization
- Cash buffer percentage

#### Daily Aggregated Metrics:
**Performance Attribution:**
- Strategy return decomposition
- Transaction cost impact
- Alpha generation vs market exposure
- Sharpe ratio (annualized, rolling 30-day)

**Risk Assessment:**
- Value at Risk (95% confidence, 1-day horizon)
- Expected shortfall
- Maximum drawdown from high-water mark
- Current vs target number of pairs

## Risk Concerns and Recommendations

### High Priority Concerns:

#### 1. Sentiment Data Dependency Risk
**Issue:** Strategy heavily dependent on news sentiment quality and availability
**Recommendation:**
- Implement sentiment data quality scoring
- Develop backup prediction model using only price/volume data
- Monitor sentiment-return correlation stability

#### 2. Gamma Factor Risk
**Issue:** Per-coin gamma calibration critical but potentially unstable
**Recommendation:**
- Use ensemble of gamma estimation methods (rolling window, exponential decay, regime-switching)
- Implement gamma confidence intervals
- Exclude coins with wide gamma confidence bands

#### 3. Rebalancing Cost Risk
**Issue:** Hourly rebalancing could erode returns through transaction costs
**Recommendation:**
- Start with 4-hour minimum rebalancing frequency
- Implement dynamic cost-benefit analysis
- Track actual vs expected trading costs

### Medium Priority Recommendations:

#### 1. Market Regime Adaptation
- Implement market volatility regime detection
- Adjust pair count and risk limits based on market conditions
- Consider market-neutral target adjustment during extreme conditions

#### 2. Model Degradation Monitoring
- Track prediction accuracy over time
- Implement model retraining triggers based on performance degradation
- Monitor sentiment factor stability and importance

#### 3. Operational Risk Controls
- Implement position size caps beyond concentration limits
- Add emergency liquidation procedures
- Establish data provider backup systems

## Production Readiness Assessment

### Strengths for Implementation:
- Well-defined risk management framework
- Appropriate market-neutral structure
- Sound theoretical foundation

### Required for Production:
- Quantitative parameter validation through backtesting
- Stress testing under various market conditions
- Operational infrastructure for real-time risk monitoring

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Implement recommended thresholds as default parameters (all tunable)**
2. **Develop comprehensive backtesting framework using specified metrics**
3. **Create risk monitoring dashboard with recommended hourly/daily metrics**
4. **Establish model performance monitoring and retraining protocols**

---

**Risk Assessment:** MODERATE-HIGH (manageable with proper controls)
**Production Readiness:** CONDITIONAL (pending backtesting validation)
**Recommendation:** PROCEED with specified risk controls and monitoring
