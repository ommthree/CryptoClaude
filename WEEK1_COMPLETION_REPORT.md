config.loadConfig("config/production.json");
bool isProduction = config.isProductionMode();
int timeout = config.getValue("database.timeout_seconds", 30);
```

```cpp
// Real-time system monitoring
SystemMonitor monitor;
monitor.setCpuThresholds(70.0, 90.0);
monitor.setMemoryThresholds(400, 500);
monitor.startMonitoring();
```

#### 3. Database Integration
**Location**: `src/Core/Database/`
- **SQLite3 integration** with WAL mode for production
- **Connection pooling** and timeout management
- **Migration support** and data quality validation
